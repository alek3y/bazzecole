# bazzecole
This repo contains most, if not all, of the notes we took to prepare for our final exam.
However, the language of the exam is primarily Italian, so that's what all the notes are written in.

You will find each subject inside the `subjects` folder which will contain notes for each topic. \
Every file is named following this format: `YYYY-MM-DD_Title_Description_Extra.adoc`.

Anyway, if you're planning to read them, take this fren with you to help ease your depression.
