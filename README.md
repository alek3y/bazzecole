# bazzecole
This repo contains most, if not all, of the notes we took to prepare for our final exam in 2022. \
However, the language of the exam is primarily Italian, so that's what all the notes are written in.

You will find each subject inside the `subjects` folder which will contain notes for each topic. \
Every file is named following this format: `YY-MM-DD_Title_Extra.md`.

Anyway, if you're planning to read them, take this fren with you to help ease your depression.
